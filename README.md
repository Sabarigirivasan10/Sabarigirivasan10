From the moment I started coding, I discovered my passion for problem-solving. Mobile app development became my canvas, where I paint with Django and React Native. Right now, I'm in the middle of an exciting project - crafting an alumni networking app.My ultimate goal is To master full-stack development. That's why I'm constantly learning and seeking out new challenges.
